future:
a prosthetics company (in notingham)(Thomson labs) are trying to grow parts of the human brain, as most other organs can now be grown and matched by using a sample of DnA from the patient relatively effectively.
brains will not grow properly without life-like stimulation.
s.n.:technology exists to copy human memories into digital data.
so in order to feed this to an artificially grown brain, they try to create a machine interface for the grown brain tissue.
so trials start with a completely digital brain and they slowly move into adding organic parts.
The outside of the brain is the easiest to grow and more likely to be damaged, so priority was on these outside parts ,but as they added more tissue the personalities started to stray more from the patient's.
s.n.: they kept the memories constant during testing throughout the iterations (alpha - nu).
the current set of brains were ordered to be kept in stasis for future experimentation, but the head researcher in this saw the brains as real humans and didn't want the brains to be left. So he ran off with the brains and the research notes (to a small village outside a scottish city, working in a local shop and using scrap and some resources from the company to build the prosthetic brains bodies).

the scientist chose to call these machines vivens, as robot means 'slave', or 'labourer', vivens means 'living'.

Meanwhile elsewhere, another company was trying to create a universal cure for all viruses. to test the extent of the cure, they created a highly mutative virus to test it on. corporate espionage agents got to the chamber where they kept this virus and, not knowing what it was, accidentaly released it.
this disease quickly spread across the world, killing almost everybody, including the scientist.

the vivens were told by the scientist that if he ever didn't come back, they should stay hidden and if he didn't come back after 6 months, they read the disc containing the memories of his life, including the research to grow more brains (their initial memories being from before his work)
